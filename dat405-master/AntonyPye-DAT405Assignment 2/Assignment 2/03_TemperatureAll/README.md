# dat405

project description :

you change the location manually by changing the name in the variable named "cityName".

this project displays the data visually based on the location that is entered with the thermometer displaying visually how cold it is through how full it is as well as the colour. there is also a rectangle in the centre displaying the name of the location that has been searched and its colour also changes depending on the temperature from blue for cold to red for warm, and finally the background changes depending on the cloud coverage from light grey to dark.

I attempted to add a search bar at the top of the project but failed to get this working correctly in time for the deadline.
